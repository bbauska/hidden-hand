<blockquote>
The Hidden Hand is a controversial Award-winning documentary that explores the possibility of an extraterrestrial 
presence here on Earth. The film takes a keen look at a spectrum of topics like alien abduction, human/alien 
hybridization, the military's reverse-engineering of alien technology and the government cover-up of anything related to 
extraterrestrials.
</blockquote>
Is preoccupation with E.T.'s a form of cultural madness, or is something really going on? How would E.T. contact 
change the religious and political institutions of our society? The Hidden Hand is full of riveting interviews 
with experts and experiencers alike: Whitley Strieber, Dr. Edgar Mitchell, the 6th astronaut on the moon, 
Paul Hellyer, a former Canadian Defence Minister, Richard Dolan, Jim Marrs, Linda Moulton Howe, Col. John Alexander, 
Lyn Buchanan, Clifford Stone, Nassim Haramein, David Icke, Dr. Roger Leir, Graham Hancock and Paola Harris, among 
others. The shadowy world of UFOs is suddenly brought to light.
