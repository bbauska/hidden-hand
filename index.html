The Hidden Hand is a controversial Award-winning documentary that explores the 
possibility of an extraterrestrial presence here on Earth. The film takes a keen 
look at a spectrum of topics like alien abduction, human/alien hybridization, the 
military’s reverse-engineering of alien technology and the government cover-up of 
anything related to extraterrestrials.

<h4>Albert Einstein (1879-1955)</h4>

<figure>

  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Albert Einstein &amp; His Connections with UFO's</figcaption>
</figure>

<article style="padding: 35px; background-color: #f6f8ff;">
<p>Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879.<br>
Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later on
began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium.<br>
Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in
1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher 
in physics and mathematics.<br>
In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable
to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office.<br>
In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s degree.</p>
<p>Einstein’s researches are, of course, well chronicled and his more important works include 
Special Theory of Relativity (1905), Relativity (English translations, 1920 and 1950), General 
Theory of Relativity (1916), Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement (1926), and The 
Evolution of Physics (1938).<br>
Among his non-scientific works, About Zionism (1930), Why War? (1933), My Philosophy (1934), and Out of 
My Later Years (1950) are perhaps the most important.</p>
<p>In a recently unearthed recording of an interview conducted over 30 years ago, a former assistant to Albert 
Einstein alleges that the famed scientist was enlisted to examine the Roswell wreckage, including the ET 
occupants of the downed craft.<br>
<br>UFO researcher Anthony Bragalia uncovered the remarkable revelation when he tracked down ufologist Sheila
Franklin, who interviewed Dr. Shirley Wright in 1993 about her time working with Einstein in the summer of 1947.<br>
<br>As luck would have it, Franklin still had the tapes from her conversation with the former assistant 
and what she told the researcher was nothing short of stunning.</p>
<p>According to Wright, she accompanied Einstein to what had been dubbed a “crisis conference” that was 
hastily held in July of 1947 at a remote army airbase in the American southwest.<br>
<br>Upon their arrival, the duo entered a hangar that was under heavy security and, when they entered the 
building, they discovered that it contained a rather curious craft that appeared to have sustained significant 
damage.<br>
"It was disc-shaped, sort of concave," Wright recalled, "its size stood up to one-fourth of 
the hangar floor."  While her response to the strange scene was one of “wonderment, half 
curiosity and maybe half fear," she said that Einstein was "not disturbed at all" and, 
instead, was primarily concerned with what sort of insights about propulsion and the universe 
could be gleaned from the vehicle.</p>
<p>The year of this Einstein quote (1952) is more than interesting.<br>
It is the same year that the Robertson Panel (on which Einstein’s associate Goudsmit served) 
was planned.<br>
It was also the same year that mass UFO sightings were occurring with frequency over Washington, DC.<br>
And it was the same year that Frank Edwards maintained Einstein had warned the
President about attacking the saucers.</p>
<p>What is more interesting about the Einstein quote is what is not said.<br>
<br>Though Einstein admits that there is reality to the phenomena ("These people are seeing something"), he 
says that he does not want to know just what it is that the people are seeing.<br>
<br>This is of course disingenuous of Einstein.<br>
<br>Since when does science shy away from encouraging finding solutions to mysteries? Einstein’s own friend and
associate Goudsmit certainly was interested in the phenomena during the same time period Einstein was writing 
Gardner about it!<br>
<br>It sounds more like Einstein simply does not wish to engage someone outside of his circle on this obviously 
sensitive matter.</p>
<p>Another interpretation is that Einstein really did not want to know because he was afraid to know.<br>
And this makes sense.<br>
If what Edwards says is true, Einstein feared the phenomenon.<br>
But what he feared more was us.<br>
Einstein feared our potential for a war-like reaction to the continued flyovers of craft that were piloted 
by beings that were not from here and that were unknown to science.</p>

<p>Richard M. Dolan is a gifted historian whose study of U.S. Cold War
strategy led him to the broader context of increased security measures
and secrecy since World War II. One aspect of such government policies
that has continued to hold the public’s imagination for over half a
century is the question of unidentified flying objects.</p>
<p>UFOs and the National Security State is the first volume of a two-part
detailed chronological narrative of the national security dimensions of
the UFO phenomenon from 1941 to the present. Working from hundreds of
declassified records and other primary and secondary sources, Dolan
centers his investigation on the American military and intelligence
communities, demonstrating that they take UFOs seriously indeed.</p>
<p>Included in this volume are the activities of more than fifty military
bases relating to UFOs, innumerable violations of sensitive airspace by
unknown craft and analyses of the Roswell controversy, the CIA-sponsored
Robertson Panel, and the Condon Committee Report. Dolan highlights the
development of civilian anti-secrecy movements, which flourished in the
1950s and 1960s until the adoption of an official government policy and
subsequent “closing of the door” during the Nixon administration.</p>

<h4>THE UFO CHALLENGE</h4>
            
<p>December 1997 By Stanton T. Friedman</p>
<p>As a nuclear physicist who has had a serious interest in flying
saucers since 1958, I have reached four major conclusions: The evidence
is overwhelming that Planet Earth is being visited by intelligently
controlled extraterrestrial spacecraft. In other words, SOME UFOs are
alien spacecraft. Most are not.</p>
<p>The subject of flying saucers represents a kind of Cosmic Watergate,
meaning that some few people in major governments have known since July,
1947, when two crashed saucers and several alien bodies were recovered
in New Mexico, that indeed SOME UFOs are ET. As noted in 1950, it’s the
most classified U.S. topic.</p>
<p>None of the arguments made against conclusions One and Two by a small
group of debunkers such as Carl Sagan, my University of Chicago
classmate for three years, can stand up to careful scrutiny.</p>
<p>The Flying Saucer story is the biggest story of the millennium:
visits to Planet Earth by aliens and the U.S. government’s cover-up of
the best data (the bodies and wreckage) for over fifty years. slide show
Since 1967 I have lectured on the subject “Flying Saucers ARE Real” at
more than 600 colleges and over 100 professional groups in all fifty US
states, nine Canadian Provinces, twelve cities in England and nine in
other countries, with only eleven hecklers. I have also appeared on
hundreds of radio and TV shows. Overall, I have probably answered about
35,000 questions about UFOs and secrecy.</p>
<p>It’s clear that over 97% of the people have NOT read any of the five
major scientific studies I discuss, and are unaware of the mountains of
evidence that support my conclusions. They are also unaware of the
scientific data, as opposed to tabloid nonsense. However, it is also
clear from the Opinion Polls and from my own experience that indeed most
people accept the notion that SOME UFOs are alien spacecraft. The
greater the education, the MORE likely an individual is to accept this
proposition. In an October 25, 1995, Oxford University Debate on the
resolution “Planet Earth is being visited by intelligent
extraterrestrial life,” the affirmative side, of which I was a part,
garnered 60% of Debate Union Member votes on the question. Ninety-two
percent of 100,000 people calling during a TV Debate in London on June
27, 1997, said Earth has been visited by aliens!</p>
<p>The problem is NOT that there is not enough evidence to justify my
conclusions; but that most people, especially the noisy negativists, are
unaware of the real, non-tabloid evidence.</p>
<p>Debunkers seem to employ four major rules: What the public doesn’t
know, we certainly won’t tell them. The largest official USAF UFO study
isn’t even mentioned in twelve anti-UFO books, though every one of those
books’ authors was aware of it.</p>
<p>Don’t bother me with the facts, my mind is made up.</p>
<p>If one can’t attack the data, attack the people. It is easier.</p>
<p>Do one’s research by proclamation rather than investigation. It is
much easier, and nobody will know the difference anyway. Many major
media people will concede that if indeed aliens are visiting earth, that
would be a major story. But because they take great pride in their
KNOWLEDGE of major stories, if this were happening they would know about
it. But they don’t. Therefore, anybody who says visits are real must be
a crackpot.</p>
<p>I have noted four major reasons why the big names in science and
journalism haven’t jumped on the pro-UFO bandwagon: Ignorance of the
data. Scratch a debunker and one usually finds somebody who is putting
down what he is not up on.</p>
<p>Fear of ridicule in sponsoring a thesis (only about ten have been
submitted relating to UFOs) if a professor, or sponsoring a detailed
reportorial investigation if an editor. I check all my audiences and
find that, while in agreement with polls, 10% have had a sighting but
only 5-10% of these witnesses have been willing to report what they saw.
Biggest reason? Fear of ridicule.</p>
<p>Ego. If aliens were visiting Earth, they would call a press
conference or ask to talk to the National Academy of Sciences. They
haven’t, so aliens must not be visiting. Flying saucers finish the job
Copernicus started in taking man out of the middle of the universe.
Priests fought Copernicus’s ideas. Today guys in lab coats, rather than
priestly robes, fight alien visitations.</p>
<p>Failure to use our knowledge of technology to understand UFO
behavior. They say “It is impossible,” rather than “I don’t know how.”
Despite the absurd claims of certain ancient academics and fossilized
physicists, it is clear on the basis of solid engineering studies that
trips to nearby stars are feasible with round trip times shorter than
the average person’s lifetime — using, for example, staged fission and
fusion propulsion systems. I have worked on both. It’s clear that
technological progress comes from doing things differently in an
unpredictable way. The history of science is littered with challenges,
leveled by people who know nothing about the job at hand, against
traditionally “impossible” claims. The cult of S.E.T.I. (Silly Effort To
Investigate) with its crazy notions that nobody would travel — but that
aliens, stuck at the level of radio, are trying to attract our attention
— mocks the notion of flying saucers, not by dealing with the evidence,
but by proclamations about the ABSENCE of evidence. This ignores
science.</p>
<p>I prove at every lecture that the NSA and CIA are withholding UFO
data. Having worked under security for fourteen years, visited seventeen
document archives, and having become aware of the huge black budgets of
the NSA, NRO, CIA, DIA, etc., I know how easy it is to keep secrets. My
nineteen years of study about crashed saucers, and thirteen years on the
Majestic-12 documents have convinced me these are real. The challenge
for us all, as we enter the new millennium, is to recognize that while
our future is in space, we are not alone. I truly hope we qualify for
admission to the Cosmic Kindergarten.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Former USAF Fighter Pilot (F86d)</li>
</ul>
<article>
US fighter pilot Dr. Milton Torres could finally talk about his engagement to shoot 24 rockets 
at a large unknown contact in the clouds off the East Coast of England in 1957.

"The date was May 20, 1957...It was a typical English night in Kent," wrote Dr. Milton Torres, 
then an F-86D fighter pilot.

A typical night in Kent meant completely cloudy skies. The "soup," as the ex-pilot referred to 
the thick cloudy weather, went from the surface to above 32,000', the highest altitude he reached that night.

Milton was a 25-year-old Lieutenant in the US Air Force, but his squadron was stationed in England. 
Milton was "sitting alert" in the new F-86D interceptor. His Wing, the 406th Fighter Interceptor 
Wing, had committed to having F-86Ds stand alert, ready to launch and shoot down the Soviet bomber 
threat on 5-minute notice.

Edgar Dean Mitchell was a United States Navy officer and aviator, test pilot, aeronautical 
engineer, ufologist, and NASA astronaut. As the Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 14 in 1971 he 
spent nine hours working on the lunar surface in the Fra Mauro Highlands region, and was 
the sixth person to walk on the Moon.

Edgar was part of the Apollo 14 space flight January 31, 1971, proceeded by the lunar 
landing on February 5th. During the two lunar EVAs (Extravehicular Activity), Mitchell 
along with his Commander Alan Shepard spent about 33 hours on the Moon.

Edgar claims that he believes in Aliens and UFOs – Aliens are Real! Claiming that we 
have been watched and observed for a long time. He mentions the Roswell alien crash
in the summer of 1947. Pointing out the reason for the US government denial was they 
weren’t sure if the specimen found was hostile. He also says the US didn’t want the 
soviets to know so a cover up was decided. Edgar claims he is positive that we are 
being watched right now.

When asked how many Alien Civilizations there are Edgar’s answer was – Billions!

<h4>Charles Hall (b. Wisconsin, US)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Retired US Army Duty Weather Observer</li>
  <li>1965-1967 - Tall Whites at Nellis AFB, Nevada</li>
  <li>IMHO, The Man is Not a Liar</li>
</ul>
  
</ul>

<article>
Charles Hall was a contactee was an airman who worked at Nellis Field and Indian Springs, Nevada,
 throughout the 1960s, enlisting in 1964. Later he was sent to Vietnam and patriotically served 
 his country in that war. I’ve heard many people online dismiss him and criticize him as a liar 
 or kook; however, I believe his testimony to be legitimate. In fact, I found his testimony to 
 be some of the most legitimate of any of the genuine contactees I have found. It was his case 
 that verified for me that ET contact is real and proven as a reality. A few years ago, I had 
 an email exchange with him about the tall whites' technology, and he confirmed parts of his 
 story for me.

Who is he? Born in Wisconsin in the mid-part of the 20th century, he had a difficult and strange
upbringing, although, in many ways, it was like other boys of the era. Later, he joined the Air 
Force and was stationed at Indian Springs, Nevada, near Las Vegas as a weather observer. However, 
what he did there was definitely more than just the weather. In his memoir, Millennial Hospitality, 
he describes how he was often alone on the ranges until he started seeing horse-shaped lights in 
the distance. The legends of locals of “range-four Harry” and a “radioactive horse” pervaded, 
especially since this was close to the Nevada Test Range, where nuclear testing was conducted.

He was terrified and thought he was hallucinating, or crazy, yet he still went out onto the 
ranges like he was ordered. Eventually, he learned they were radioactive, not a horse, but 
humanoid extraterrestrials that wore bright outfits that could float. The tall whites were 
normally human-sized but could grow up to 7 or 8 feet tall in old age, were very thin, and 
had a pale white complexion. They wore human clothes however also wore bright suits that 
allowed them to float. They had white “tic-tac” shaped spacecraft that could float silently 
and travel thousands of kilometers an hour. He noticed the schedule of their deep-black 
spacecraft that flew on the schedule of the moon.

He eventually befriended some and believed they came from a star close to Arcturus in the 
constellation Bootes. There were difficult situations like the woman “Pamela” that he met 
that shot him with what was basically a phaser. A microwave beam weapon that incapacitated 
him. In fact, the technology the tall whites possessed isn’t that different from Battlestar 
Galactica, Star Wars, or Star Trek. “The Teacher” was a guide to their culture and people, 
and in many ways, they weren’t all that different from modern Americans; however, in other 
ways they are quite distinct. They didn’t eat meat; they were only vegetarian, could be 
capricious, or caring; they could also read Charlie’s mind with the help of technology 
they used, like Alan from the White Sands Incident.

<h2>Evidence</h2>
However, the skeptics will immediately retort, “Charles Hall is a fraud or a liar.” This 
isn’t true; I can prove it. First, the military records he has in his books prove he was 
at Nellis and was in the military doing some of what he claimed he did. Read the books 
yourself and determine this for yourself; he wasn’t lying about that. His service record 
speaks for itself; he was stationed at Nellis as an airman. Secondly, Paola Harris, the 
noted researcher, has done extensive research on Charles, even taking him out to Indian 
Springs again so he can guide her to where the ranges were located. Many describe him 
as intelligent, likes to play chess, and experienced something strange, confirming the 
legends of “range Four-Harry.”

Key parts of Hall’s story, like the building of an underground spaceport for the Tall Whites, 
are documented in newspaper articles of the time. According to the article around $300 million 
dollars were spent, inflation-adjusted, that would be around $3.5 billion dollars today. What 
kind of simple housing facility costs $3.5 billion dollars? For reference, the nearby housing 
complex at Ft. Bliss cost $4.8 billion, housing more than 37,000 soldiers and 10 million square 
feet of space. However, Ft. Bliss is like a small city. It was more like they were building a 
small city out in Indian Springs than simple barracks. Indian Springs, today Creech AFB, has 
some facilities but nothing that seems like it would have cost that amount back then.

Hall was enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1964 and was stationed at a remote weather 
shack on the Nellis Air Force Base outside Las Vegas, Nevada, in ’65. There, he was tasked 
with observing weather patterns on the Gunnery ranges at Indian Springs.

Soon after marrying his wife, Marie-Therese, he disclosed that he had many encounters with 
what he described as “Tall Whites” at Indian Springs. Although not particularly interested 
in ETs, she believed him. Nevertheless, the topic remained private as they raised a family.

After eighteen years, Marie-Therese was surprised to learn her husband had been writing 
memoirs about his experiences. After reading them, she encouraged him to publish the 
memoirs, which share a unique recollection with many interesting details of what he 
claims took place.

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>Philip James Corso (May 22, 1915 – July 16, 1998) was an American
Army officer.</p>
<p>He served in the United States Army from February 23, 1942, to March
1, 1963, and earned the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.</p>
<p>Corso published The Day After Roswell, about how he was involved in
the research of extraterrestrial technology recovered from the 1947
Roswell UFO Incident. On July 23, 1997, he was a guest on the popular
late night radio show, Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell where he spoke
live about his Roswell story. This interview was rebroadcast by Coast to
Coast AM on July 3, 2010.</p>
<h4 id="the-day-after-roswell">The Day After Roswell</h4>
<p>In his book The Day After Roswell (co-author William J. Birnes)
claims he stewarded extraterrestrial artifacts recovered from a crash
near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.</p>
<p>Corso says a covert government group was assembled under the
leadership of the first Director of Central Intelligence, Adm. Roscoe H.
Hillenkoetter. Among its tasks was to collect all information on
off-planet technology. The US administration simultaneously discounted
the existence of flying saucers in the eyes of the public, Corso
says.</p>
<p>According to Corso, the reverse engineering of these artifacts
indirectly led to the development of accelerated particle beam devices,
fiber optics, lasers, integrated circuit chips and Kevlar material.</p>
<p>In the book, Corso claims the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), or
“Star Wars”, was meant to achieve the destructive capacity of electronic
guidance systems in incoming enemy warheads, as well as the disabling of
enemy spacecraft, including those of extraterrestrial origin.</p>
<p>Different parts of the Roswell craft were sent to various defense
companies, who reverse engineered their properties. This engineering
feat eventually led to a number of breakthroughs. Among them were
integrated circuitry, night vision equipment, the laser, particle beams,
and fiber optics. The contractors were told that the parts were stolen
from Russia.</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>
I came to know Dr. Dan Burisch (formerly Dan Crain, Ph.D.) many years
ago in Las Vegas NV. He and his family became friends with my family and
I…. and eventually I came to know his story well. He asked me, in 1997
to write a book about one of his research projects. That became Eagles
Disobey: The Case for Inca City, Mars and was released to the public in
1998. During that work I came to know a great deal about Dan’s
involvement in dark projects that are covertly funded by our military
and governmen bodies - including his work up at Area-51, or as it is
known by those who work up there: Watertown Strip. Dan became afraid,
desperately afraid for his life toward the end of the work on Eagles
Disobey. He was terrified of retailiation from his dark project
supervisors because he refused to stop looking into the anomalies on
Mars - and because he had shared with me many of his experiences “up
north” while he was employed in Project Aquarius, and had familiarity
with Project Sigma, and Looking Glass.
</p>
<p>
Toward the end of 1998 Dan disappeared. His residence was abandoned
overnight, and nobody seemed to know where he had been taken. He turned
up half way across the country, with most of his memories concerning his
association with me and our work on Eagles Disobey altered or erased. I
tried my best to remind him of his past, but he did not believe me until
I showed him a copy of the book and photographs of himself sitting on my
couch playing with the dogs. He returned to his new location, but
memories started to break through the conditioning to such an extent
that Dan fled and was eventually recaptured and whisked off to a
military base for re-conditioning. When they realized that they couldn’t
keep it up with out damaging his ability to think and function
(remember, they wanted him to continue to work for them in his capacity
as team leader and microbiologist) they decided to re-wind his memories
and return him to Las Vegas under the careful observation of his spouse,
who relays all communication up the pipeline, and signs much of her
correspondence with her title/designation PsiOpSec.
</p>
<p>
I was permitted very limited contact with him during that time, mostly
because he made life unbearable until they honored his demand to talk to
me. But he was eventually moved again and housed at the Papoose Lab
facility where he could conduct critical biological studies on captive
entity they had housed in their lab, on Level-5. Contact was
intermittent, but then, in early 2001 I got a strange email that caught
my attention. It was from mj01@missilemail.com. Since I knew that Dan
was involved with Majestic and MJ12, I was immediately on alert. It
turned out to be from a person inside the project Dan was working on,
who was so upset with the situation that he felt compelled to seek my
help. He was aware of my identity and long standing friendship with Dan
because it was contained in the briefings he got prior to accepting his
assignment, and figured I might be willing to assist. My contact is now
dead. He was discovered communicating with me, and was involuntarily
“retired”. His letters read as follows, and give a troubling glimpse
into the prison-like world that was created to maintain control of
Dr. Dan Burisch and force him to comply with the wishes of the ‘powers
that be’ as he eventually came to call them.

</figure>

<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>John Lear, retired airline captain, with over 19,000 hours of
flight-time, has flown in over 100 different types of planes in 60
different counties around the world.</p>
<p>Son of Lear Jet inventor, Bill Lear, John is the only pilot to hold
every FAA airplane certificate, to include airplane transport rating,
flight instructor, ground instructor, flight navigator, engineer,
aircraft dispatcher, airframe powerplant mechanic, parachute rigger, and
tower operator.</p>
<p>He flew secret missions for the CIA in Central and Southeast Asia,
Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa between 1966 and 1983. He has
flown as Captain and check pilot for over 10 different airlines.</p>
<p>John held 17 world records including speed around the world in a Lear
Jet Model 24, set in 1966. He was presented with the PATCO award for
outstanding airmanship in 1968, and the Symons Wave memorial. He was the
youngest American to climb the Matterhorn in Switzerland in 1959 and in
the 1970’s owned and skippered the Americas Cup boat, the Soliloquy, out
of Marina Del Rey.</p>
<p>In 1968, John raced a Douglas B26 Invader in the unlimited class at
the Reno air races.</p>
<p>He was a Senior Vice Commander of the China Post 1, the American
Legion Post for Soldiers of Fortune. He is a 20 year member of the
special operations Association.</p>
<p>John is the current owner and operator of the only permitted gold
mine operation Cutthroat Mining Corporation in Clarke County, Nevada.
His efforts to clean up the Treasure Hawk Gold Butte mine won him the
state of Nevada award for excellence in mining reclamation in 1999. John
is a MSHA (Mine, Safety, and Health Administration) and holds a blaster
license from the Nevada certified mining instructor from the Nevada
State Fire Marshall.</p>
<p>John’s passion for the preservation and documentation of the history
of the Gold Butte has made him a authority on the area.</p>
<p>John has been a resident of Las Vegas since 1994 and was a republican
State Senate candidate in 1980.</p>
<p>John has 4 daughters, 2 grandchildren, and lives with his wife in Las
Vegas. - Las Vegas businesswoman, Mary Lee Lear in Sunrise Manor.</p>
<p>In 1988, John met and became friends with Bob Lazar, the government
scientist who worked on the back-engineering of the propulsion system of
the extraterrestrial UFOs at area S-4. That’s just outside the infamous
and ultrasecret Area 51.</p>
<p>In March 1989, Lazar took John to an area close to Rachel Nevada
where he witnessed the flight of a flying saucer at the exact time Lazar
told him it would occur.</p>
<p>Two weeks later on another UFO spying mission, John, Lazar and 3
others were caught by security forces - (that’s CAUGHT folks) - and the
next day, - the very next day - Lazar lost his job at the government
program for that breach of security. Lazar has been branded by many as a
fraud, a charge to which John responds, ” Those who say that Lazar was a
fraud simply don’t know the facts of this incredible 12 month period. I
was there - they weren’t.”</p>
<p>During the late 1980’s, John tracked down and found the Army
Intelligence Analyst who read, probably by accident, the U.S. government
report Grudge 13, which documented the history of the U.S. UFO coverup
and details of saucer recoveries, disposition of their occupants, and
handling (That’s HANDLING) of civilian witnesses.</p>
<p>The report included clear photographs of these recovered
extraterrestrial craft and beings - (That’s BEINGS) found inside. It
further detailed how recoveries were made worldwide and specially
designed transports to accommodate the craft.</p>
<p>John spent time poking around other UFO related areas to include
Dulce, Secora, Aztec, Alamagorda, Albuquerque, Los Alamos and Bentwaters
airbase near London.</p>
<p>Since that time, John has learned many incredible and interesting
facts about the solar system and planets including the existence of huge
structures, arches, bridges and domes on the moon, cities on Mars, huge
extraterrestrial ships mining the rings of Saturn, the incredible but
secret agenda of Apollo 17, to the huge rectangular opening in the south
massif of the Taurus-Littrow Highlands called Nansen.</p>

<p>Title: View of lunarscape at Station 4 with Astronaut Schmitt working
at LRV</p>
<p>Description: A view of the lunarscape at Station 4 (Shorty Crater)
showing Scientist-Astronaut Harrison H. Schmitt working at the lunar
roving vehicle (LRV) during the second Apollo 17 extravehicular activity
(EVA-2) at the Taurus-Littrow landing site. (Lunar landing site: 20.2 N,
30.8 E ) This is the area where Schmitt first spotted the orange soil.
Orange soil is clearly visible on either side of the rover in this
picture. Shorty Crater is to the right. The peak in the center
background is Family Mountain. A portion of South Massif is on the
horizon at the left edge. (Apollo 17 samples)</p>
<p>NOTE: The Valley of Taurus-Littrow</p>
<p>The image linked here is a portion of Pan Camera frame AS17-2309
showing the South Massif at the upper right and the Sculptured Hills at
the lower left. The North Massif is at the bottom right and Henry Crater
is the rightmost of the three large craters in a triangular pattern at
the foot of the mountain. This orientation is to facilitate comparison
with features in the Station 6 high resolution images below. See also
the labeled version of this frame. The distance from Station 6 above
Henry to the LM is 3.5 km; to Bear Mountain, about 8 km; and to the
outcrop noted in 21498 below, about 18 km. Scans by Ron Wells.</p>
<p>Apollo 17 Pan Camera frame AS17-2309 Details</p>
<p>The frame was taken on December 11, 1972 at 23:47:38.1 GMT during CSM
Rev 15 from an altitude of 113.07 km. In terms of the mission time, the
photo was taken at 116:54:38 – just seven minutes before Gene and Jack
started their watches for the first EVA. John Pfannerstill has scanned
three portions of the frame.</p>
<p>In the central area around the LM, the largest crater is Camelot at
the upper left. A labeled version highlights the LM and Poppie. In the
area north of the LM, covering the EVA-3 traverse, Henry is the large
crater at the foot of the North Massif just above and to the right of
the center of the image. In the area west of the LM, covering the EVA-2
traverse, Nansen is at the lower left, Camelot is at the right edge
above center, and Shorty is the sharp-rimmed, dark-edged crater at top
center, about a Camelot diameter below the top edge of the image.</p>

</figure>

<p>Leonard Stringfield (1920–1994) was an American ufologist who took
particular interest in crashed flying saucer stories. He died in
1994.[1]</p>
<p>Stringfield was director of Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying
Objects (CRIFO), and published a monthly newsletter, ORBIT. In 1957 he
became public relations adviser for the civilian UFO group, National
Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), under the
direction of Donald Keyhoe, a friend since 1953. From 1967 to 1969,
Stringfield served as an “Early Warning Coordinator” for the Condon
Committee. During the 1970s, he wrote a number of books about alleged
recoveries of alien spaceships and alien bodies.</p>
<p>In 1978, Stringfield served as UFO research adviser to Grenada Prime
Minister Sir Eric Gairy. Privately, Stringfield worked as Director of
Public Relations and Marketing Services for DuBois Chemicals, a division
of Chemed Corporation, Cincinnati. He self-published “Status Reports” on
alleged UFO “crash-retrievals” until his death. He died December 18,
1994 after a long battle with lung cancer.[1]</p>

<h4>World War II sighting</h4>

<p>Stringfield’s interest in the subject began August 28, 1945, just
three days before the end of the war, when he was an Army Air Force
intelligence officer en route to Tokyo, Japan, along with twelve other
specialists in the Fifth Air Force. As they approached Iwo Jima at about
ten thousand feet in a sunlit sky, Stringfield related:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I was shocked to see three teardrop-shaped objects from my
starboard-side window. They were brilliantly white, like burning
magnesium, and closing in on a parallel course to our C-46. Suddenly,
our left engine feathered, and I was later to learn that the magnetic
navigation-instrument needles went wild. As the C-46 lost altitude, with
oil spurting from the troubled engine, the pilot sounded an alert; crew
and passengers were told to prepare for a ditch! I do not recall my
thoughts or actions during the next, horrifying moments, but my last
glimpse of the three bogies placed them about 20 degrees above the level
of our transport. Flying in the same, tight formation, they faded into a
cloud bank. Instantly, our craft’s engine revved up, and we picked up
altitude and flew a steady course to land safely at Iwo Jima.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>UFO interest rekindled</h4>

<p>Stringfield said his World War II encounter was so traumatic that he
tried to forget about it. But he was drawn back into the UFO field in
1950 when two very sincere people related flying saucer sightings to
him. Stringfield then wrote:</p>
<p>“This one experience near Iwo Jima was proof enough to me in 1950
that the ‘foo fighter’ of World War II–sometimes dubbed ‘Kraut fireball’
in the European Theater–and the flying saucer were one and the same kind
of machine and from the same source: outer space.”</p>
<p>Uneasy about the “rumored loss of Air Force interceptors chasing
UFOs, the low-level green fireballs over Sweden and the southwestern
United States” and his own experience, Stringfield related he was
concerned about the “intent” behind the probes. In March 1954, he
created Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects (CRIFO), and
published a monthly newsletter, ORBIT.</p>
<p>The newsletter caught the attention of radio newscaster Frank
Edwards, who allowed Stringfield to announce it on his popular program
in May. Instantly, Stringfield was deluged with mail and newspapers, and
radio stations from coast to coast called, wanting saucer news.
Stringfield soon had 2500 paid subscribers to ORBIT. During the
mid-1950s, CRIFO became the world’s largest civilian UFO research
group.</p>
<p>Then Stringfield wrote, “Also taking note of CRIFO was the Air
Force.” Stringfield said the Air Defense Command in Columbus, Ohio
called him September 9, 1955, and wanted his cooperation in obtaining
immediate sighting reports using his large network of sources. To his
surprise, he was also informed that the Ground Observer Corps (GOC) in
southwestern Ohio had been instructed to report UFO activity directly to
him for screening. (Stringfield lived in Cincinnati, Ohio.) He was then
to call the ADC using a telephone code number (“Fox Trot Kilo 3-0 Blue”)
to report the better sightings. He was requested “not to ask any
questions.”</p>
<p>Later a member of the GOC informed him as to what happened to his
screened reports. If the sighting was confirmed by radar, jets were then
scrambled for intercept and the matter became classified. Stringfield
recounted one such spectacular incident, on the night of August 23/24,
1955, when multiple UFOs were spotted on radar in the
Columbus/Cincinnati region. Numerous jets were sent up for intercept
over a wide region, but cloud cover prevented Stringfield from seeing
what was happening, though he could hear the jets overhead.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the Air Force cleared his reporting of the incident
in his newsletter. But when he tried to interest the local Cincinnati
newspapers, the story was officially denied, as was his connection with
the ADC.</p>
<p>Despite the official public denial of his work for the ADC,
Stringfield wrote that he received a letter in 1956, thanking him for
his assistance from no less than Major General John A. Samford, director
of Air Force Intelligence. He also received a letter in 1955 from
Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, who had been director of the Air Force’s
public UFO investigation Project Blue Book from 1951-1953. Ruppelt was
requesting information on CRIFO for the book he was writing at the time
(The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects), and praised the
report-collecting net Stringfield had established.</p>
<p>Stringfield said he continued his “cooperation” with the Air Force
through 1956 until the GOC was disbanded and his screening duties for
them ceased. Stringfield’s relationship with the ADC during this period
is recounted in his 1957 book, Inside Saucer Post, 3-0 Blue and in his
1977 book, Situation Red.</p>
<p>In 1957, Stringfield discontinued CRIFO and his monthly newsletter.
The same year, he became public relations adviser for the newly formed
civilian UFO group NICAP under the direction of Donald Keyhoe, a friend
of his since 1953. He held the post until 1972, at which point he
continued his private UFO research.</p>
<p>For over 30 years, Stringfield served in several of the major UFO
Organizations in a public relations capacity. From 1957 to 1970, he was
public relations adviser with the National Investigations Committee on
Aerial Phenomena. Later on, he was director of public relations and
board member of the Mutual UFO Network. He was also regional
investigator for the Center for UFO Studies directed by Dr. J. Allen
Hynek.</p>
<p>From 1967-1969, Stringfield served as an “Early Warning Coordinator”
for the so-called Condon Committee, the government sponsored scientific
UFO investigation. His job, like his earlier one for the ADC, was to
screen and report all UFO activity in southwestern Ohio.</p>
<p>It was during the 1970s that Stringfield began collecting witness
accounts of UFO crash recoveries, including alien bodies. Many of these
stories centered around activities at nearby Wright-Patterson AFB in
Dayton, Ohio.</p>
<p>Also, when Grenada Prime Minister Sir Eric Gairy proposed the
establishment of a UFO research agency within the United Nations in
1978, during the 32nd General Assembly of the UN, Stringfield served as
his adviser.</p>
<p>Stringfield retired in 1981 as Director of Public Relations and
Marketing Services for DuBois Chemicals, a division of Chemed Corp,
after 31 years service with the company.</p>
<p>Stringfield first publicly reported his so-called “crash/retrieval”
findings at a 1978 MUFON Symposium. He said he received two death
threats beforehand, but was never sure who was behind them or how
serious they were. Thereafter, he self-published seven “Status Reports”
on new crash-retrieval research until his death in 1994.</p>
