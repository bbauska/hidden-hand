But the Tall Whites are more than just fiction, says Charles Hall, an educated man with a master’s in nuclear physics and former weather observer for the United States Air Force.

According to Hall, who claims to have communicated with the Tall Whites, they are very real, very complex and very much a part of the community living at Nellis Air Force Base, a highly secretive 5,000 square mile “no fly zone” military compound in the southern and central Nevada desert.

“Their life span is ten times grater than ours,” said Hall, adding that it takes them 10 times longer to heal, too. “They do not age as we do, but at about 400 earth years, they undergo a second stage of growth, eventually reaching about 8 feet tall. They then die of organ failure at an age of approximately 800 years. Since on their planet, days are longer so are they sleeping patterns, usually staying awake for two earth days and then followed by sleeping the same amount of time.”

What’s unusual is the suit emits a three-inch field of white fluorescent light, the intensity varying from soft to bright, a brightness that can actually hurt the human eye.

They are extremely intelligent and process information speed several times faster than humans. However, secretly they fear our intuitive ability and extra sensory perceptions. They have individual talents, differing intellectual capabilities and physical traits, a race definitely not carved from a cookie-cutter. Some are teachers, some are pilots, some are workers and some are leaders. When bored, they like to go star gazing on hot summer nights, take weekend trips to the strip in Las Vegas or visit the Lincoln Monument in Washington D.C.

They all have thin, straight blond hair, usually worn short and the women can be distinguished by a feminine looking short cut. Their hips are shaped liked ours, but they walk quite differently since they are used to a stronger gravity pull. They typically can be seen wearing aluminized chalk white jump suits resembling a canvas-like fabric with gloves of the same material and an open white motorcycle helmet.

Some stand more than 8 feet tall, run 40 mph and live 800 years. They speak like a dog barking or a bird chirping, write similar to Egyptian hieroglyphics and have learned English quite easily. They have large blue eyes that wrap part way around their heads, small noses and tiny ears pressed tight to their scalps. Their thumbs are small with four long slender fingers and two claw-like appendages instead of fingernails.

Hall was enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1964 and was stationed at a remote weather shack on the Nellis Air Force Base outside Las Vegas, Nevada, in ’65. There, he was tasked with observing weather patterns on the Gunnery ranges at Indian Springs.
